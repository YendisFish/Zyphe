# Zyphe

Zyphe is my programming language that I'm making to
run on the [Rainbow runtime](https://github.com/luminous-foundation/Rainbow).
The purpose of this language is to encourage thought into how memory is used. I designed
the language so that people would distinguish between heap and stack memory purposefully.


# How to Build

You will need to have dotnet 8 installed in order to build the compiler

# Docs

You can find the language specs [here](./Mockups/specs.md).
